# Linear Regression

1. These models are created and verified on Octave 5.1.0
2. Linear Regression Model attempts 4 use-cases on Weather in Szeged 2006-2016 dataset from Kaggel

   a. Attempt 1 - Predict the relationship between humidity and temperature 
      Efficiency = 96.4177% 
   b. Attempt 2 - Predict the relationship between humidity and apparent temperature 
      Efficiency = 96.4417% 
   c. Attempt 3 - Model to predict the humidity given the temperature 
      - We have already used the Linear Regression and found that the Attempt 2 is a better prediction model 
   d. Attempt 4 - Predict the relationship between humidity and temperature and apparent temperature 
      Effeciency = 96.3853%
