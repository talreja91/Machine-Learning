1. These models are created and verified on Octave 5.1.0 <br/>
2. Linear Regression Model attempts 4 use-cases on Weather in Szeged 2006-2016 dataset from Kaggel
<br/>
   a. Attempt 1 - Predict the relationship between humidity and temperature <br/>
      Efficiency = 96.4177% <br/>
   b. Attempt 2 - Predict the relationship between humidity and apparent temperature <br/>
      Efficiency = 96.4417% <br/>
   c. Attempt 3 - Model to predict the humidity given the temperature <br/>
      - We have already used the Linear Regression and found that the Attempt 2 is a better prediction model <br/>
   d. Attempt 4 - Predict the relationship between humidity and temperature and apparent temperature <br/>
      Effeciency = 96.3853% <br/>
